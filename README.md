# Welcome to MathG!
Ultra-light GPU-accelerated mathematics library. Developed mostly for [NeuroG](https://github.com/Meta-chan/NeuroG).

### Dependencies
At the moment MathG depends on [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) or [FreeGlut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net)), and [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library).

### Platforms
Currently Windows x86 only, but in perspective can be ported on every platform that provides OpenGL API. In nearest future I plan to port it on Linux x86.

### Installation
The installation process is integrated with [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library), follow the link for more. But in a nutshell, you can do just this:
```c++
#define IR_IMPLEMENT
#include <mathg.h>
```

### Documentation
The code is pretty self-documented. But more importantly, I provide [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html) documentation! It does not look too pretty since I am not an expert, but it is still quite informative. And of course, feel free to contact me!

###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.
